DNS Bruter
=========

DNS Bruter is an open source multi-threaded penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting subdomains of a domain.<br>

It is based on the [dnsbruter](https://github.com/marpie/dnsbruter) of [Markus Pieton](https://github.com/marpie).

Features
----

* ZoneTransfers for nameservers
* Bruteforcing from wordlist
* Wildcard domains are supported!

Installation
----

You can download the latest tarball by clicking [here](https://github.com/whoot/dnsbruter/tarball/master) or latest zipball by clicking  [here](https://github.com/whoot/dnsbruter/zipball/master).

Preferably, you can download dnsbruter by cloning the [Git](https://github.com/whoot/dnsbruter) repository:

    git clone https://github.com/whoot/dnsbruter.git

DNSBruter works with [Python](http://www.python.org/download/) version **3.x** on Debian/Ubuntu and RedHat (and Windows) platforms.

On every platform you need following packages:

* [dnspython](http://www.dnspython.org/)
* [Requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/)
* [Colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama)

On Redhat you can install all needed packages with easy_install:

	easy_install argparse
	easy_install requests
	easy_install colorama

WARNING: 
----
I really, really donÂ´t recommend to use it on Windows, because Windows has some fucked up timeout ratings!
Use it on Linux, comment out the "search xxx" in /etc/resolv.conf and be happy :) 

Usage
----

To get a list of all options use:

    python3 dnsbruter.py -h

You can use DNSBruter with domains:

	python3 dnsbruter.py -d DOMAIN [DOMAIN ...]

Or with a file with a list of domains:

	python3 dnsbruter.py -f FILE

Example:<br>
Find all subdomains of example.com (with default subdomainlist):

	python3 dnsbruter.py -d example.com
